# Flap Hero

This is the source code for [Flap Hero](https://arc80.com/flaphero/), a small, free game that runs on multiple platforms. It's available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arc80.flaphero) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/flap-hero/id1538082494).

Flap Hero is built using [Plywood](https://github.com/arc80/plywood). See [this blog post](https://preshing.com/20201126/a-small-open-source-game-in-cpp) for more information.

At this time, it's only possible to build the **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS** versions of Flap Hero. You can't build the Android or iOS versions yet. (See "Why Can't I Build on Android or iOS?" at the end of this document.) In the meantime, rest assured that the game works basically the same way on all platforms.

#### About These Build Instructions

Please note that Plywood is still a young project, and Flap Hero is the first Plywood application that relies on several third-party libraries at the same time. Therefore, be warned that the following build steps are not exactly easy — but they're doable.

Over time, as Plywood improves, these builds steps will become simpler. Please consider [backing the project on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/preshing) if you'd like to support that effort!

Thanks to Jean-Noé Morissette for help with the initial Android port.

## Build Instructions

First, follow Plywood's [Quick Start](https://plywood.arc80.com/docs/QuickStart) guide to create a Plywood workspace. After following that guide, the `plytool` (or `plytool.exe`) executable should be located in your workspace root.

(It will also help if you build Plywood's [Hello World](https://plywood.arc80.com/docs/QuickStart/HelloWorld) sample application at least once before trying to build Flap Hero, to familiarize yourself with Plywood concepts, but that isn't strictly required.)

Clone the FlapHero repo directly under the `repos` folder relative to your [workspace root](https://plywood.arc80.com/docs/DirectoryStructure).

    $ cd repos
    $ git clone https://github.com/arc80/FlapHero

After cloning the FlapHero repo, there should be a `repos/FlapHero` folder relative to the workspace root.

Next, run PlyTool's code generation step. Execute the following command in the workspace root, where the `plytool` executable is located. (If you're using Windows, run `.\plytool` instead of `./plytool`.)

    $ ./plytool codegen

After that, run:

    $ ./plytool build --auto glfwFlap

The first time you run the above command, it will automatically create a new build folder, add the `glfwFlap` target to that build folder, and attempt to generate a build system in that folder using CMake. At this point, you're sure to encounter errors related to missing (or "not selected") third-party libraries, similar to the following:

    Created build folder 'glfwFlap' with root target 'glfwFlap' at: C:\Jeff\FlapHero-latest\plywood\data\build\glfwFlap\
    Can't generate build system in folder 'glfwFlap' because extern 'assimp' is not selected.
    No compatible providers are available for extern 'assimp'.
    Can't generate build system in folder 'glfwFlap' because extern 'soloud' is not selected.
    1 compatible provider is available:
        soloud.source (not installed)
    Can't generate build system in folder 'glfwFlap' because extern 'glfw' is not selected.
    1 compatible provider is available:
        glfw.prebuilt (not installed)

To resolve those errors, you need to tell PlyTool which [extern provider](https://plywood.arc80.com/docs/KeyConcepts#extern-providers) to use for each of the third-party libraries it needs. Do that by skipping to the appropriate "Installing Third-Party Libraries" section below, depending on your OS.

## Installing Third-Party Libraries on Windows

#### 1. Installing Assimp

Assimp can be installed using [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg). Please note that Plywood's support for Vcpkg is not very mature right now, so you'll have to perform a lot of manual steps.

If you don't already have Vcpkg installed somewhere, go ahead and install it under the `data` folder relative to your workspace root. Then use Vcpkg to install Assimp. All of that can be done using the following commands. (Don't worry about making a mess; everything will be contained inside the `data\vcpkg` folder.)

    (from the workspace root)
    > cd data
    > git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
    > .\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
    > .\vcpkg\vcpkg install assimp:x64-windows
    (wait a while...)
    > cd ..

Now, from the workspace root folder, update your `PATH` environment variable so that PlyTool is able to locate `vcpkg.exe`. (If you have Vcpkg installed to a different path, specify that path instead. Make sure you've installed Assimp in that instance of Vcpkg, too.)

    (from the workspace root)
    > set "PATH=%CD%\data\vcpkg;%PATH%"

Finally, tell PlyTool that the current build folder should use the `assimp.vcpkg` provider:

    > .\plytool extern select --install assimp.vcpkg

#### 2. Installing SoLoud

Install and select the `soloud.source` provider in the current build folder using the following command. This command will download and extract SoLoud's source code from the [official SoLoud website](http://sol.gfxile.net/soloud/). SoLoud will be compiled later, at the same time that Flap Hero is built.

    > .\plytool extern select --install soloud.source

#### 3. Installing GLFW

Install and select the `glfw.prebuilt` provider in the current build folder using the following command. This will download and extract precompiled GLFW libraries from the [GLFW releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases).

    > .\plytool extern select --install glfw.prebuilt

Finally, skip to the "Finishing Up" section below.

## Installing Third-Party Libraries on Linux

On Linux, Flap Hero currently gets its dependencies from [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)), except for SoLoud which gets built from source at the same time that Flap Hero is built. Therefore, only Ubuntu and Debian are directly supported by these build steps. (It's possible to add support for additional package managers; it just hasn't been done yet.)

You can pre-install Assimp and GLFW using the following command line. This isn't absolutely necessary, but it avoids the need for PlyTool to request elevated permissions.

    $ sudo apt-get install libassimp-dev libglfw3-dev

From the workspace root folder, execute the following commands. This will select the necessary providers in the current build folder.

    (from the workspace root)
    $ ./plytool extern select --install assimp.apt
    $ ./plytool extern select --install soloud.source
    $ ./plytool extern select --install glfw.apt

Finally, skip to the "Finishing Up" section below.

## Installing Third-Party Libraries on macOS

On macOS, Flap Hero currently gets its dependencies from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), except for SoLoud which gets built from source at the same time that Flap Hero is built. Make sure you have Homebrew installed by following the instructions [on the official website](https://brew.sh).

From the workspace root folder, execute the following commands. This will select the necessary providers in the current build folder.

    (from the workspace root)
    $ ./plytool extern select --install assimp.homebrew
    $ ./plytool extern select --install soloud.source
    $ ./plytool extern select --install glfw.homebrew

Finally, go to the "Finishing Up" section below.

## Finishing Up

After completing the above steps, it should be possible to build Flap Hero by running:

    $ ./plytool build
    
You can also run Flap Hero from the command line by running `./plytool run`, and open the generated project file in your IDE (such as Visual Studio or Xcode) by running `./plytool open`.

## Why Can't I Build on Android or iOS?

This repository doesn't contain the additional source code and project files needed to build on Android and iOS. I'd like to release those files, but they aren't distribution-ready at this time. The project files in particular were created by hand, and are mess of hardcoded paths that require lots of manual steps to make them work. It would be nearly impossible to support them if they were released. ([Let me know on the Discord server](https://discord.gg/WnQhuVF) if you're interested in them anyway. If enough people are interested, I could upload these files in a zipfile somewhere, but they won't be supported.)

It would be nice to add native Android/iOS support to Plywood, but that's not a high priority at this time.
